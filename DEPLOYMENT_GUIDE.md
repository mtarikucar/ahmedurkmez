# AhmedUrkMez Production Deployment System

A comprehensive deployment and backup automation system for the AhmedUrkMez project.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Setup automated backups
./scripts/setup-cron.sh

# Deploy the application
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh deploy full
```

## üìã Available Scripts

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-manager.sh` - Central deployment manager (recommended)
- `deploy-full.sh` - Deploy entire application stack
- `deploy-backend.sh` - Deploy only backend service
- `deploy-frontend.sh` - Deploy only frontend service

### Backup Scripts
- `backup-daily.sh` - Daily backup (database, uploads, configs)
- `backup-weekly.sh` - Weekly backup (comprehensive)
- `backup-monthly.sh` - Monthly backup (archival)

### Utility Scripts
- `setup-cron.sh` - Setup automated backup schedules
- `generate-ssl.sh` - Generate SSL certificates

## üéõÔ∏è Deployment Manager Usage

The deployment manager is the recommended way to interact with the system:

```bash
# Deploy services
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh deploy full      # Full deployment
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh deploy backend   # Backend only
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh deploy frontend  # Frontend only

# Run backups
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh backup daily     # Daily backup
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh backup weekly    # Weekly backup
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh backup monthly   # Monthly backup

# System management
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh status           # Show system status
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh logs nginx       # Show service logs
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh restart backend  # Restart service
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh monitor          # Live monitoring dashboard
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh rollback         # Rollback deployment

# Setup and maintenance
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh setup            # Setup automation
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh update           # Update scripts
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment:

### Triggers
- **Push to main branch**: Automatic full deployment
- **Pull Request**: Build and test only
- **Manual dispatch**: Choose deployment type (full/backend/frontend)

### Workflow Steps
1. **Build & Test**: Compile and test both backend and frontend
2. **Security Scan**: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
3. **Docker Build**: Build and push container images
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to production server
5. **Verify**: Health checks and deployment verification
6. **Notify**: Deployment status notifications

### Required Secrets
Configure these secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `PRODUCTION_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: SSH private key for production server

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check service status
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh status

# Check logs
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh logs backend
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh logs frontend

# Restart services
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh restart
```

#### Health Checks Failing
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend

# Restart unhealthy services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart backend
```

#### Out of Disk Space
```bash
# Clean up old Docker resources
docker system prune -a

# Clean up old backups
find backups/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;

# Check disk usage
df -h
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Database Recovery
```bash
# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Restore from latest backup
gunzip -c backups/latest/database.sql.gz | \
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T postgres \
  psql -U postgres ahmedurkmez_db

# Start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

#### Full System Recovery
```bash
# Use the deployment manager rollback
./scripts/deploy-manager.sh rollback

# Or manually restore from backup
./scripts/deploy-full.sh
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Docker Optimization
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Layer caching for faster builds
- Resource limits for containers
- Health checks for reliability

### Application Optimization
- Production environment variables
- Compression middleware
- Static file optimization
- Database connection pooling

## üîí Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
